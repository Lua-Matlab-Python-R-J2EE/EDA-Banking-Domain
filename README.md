## Project Overview

ABC Bank is planning to introduce a new credit card in a competitive and rapidly expanding financial market. To ensure a successful launch, an extensive analysis will be performed on a dataset containing over 50,000 records, simulating real-world customer behavior and market conditions.

## Problem Statement

As a new entrant in the credit card sector, ABC Bank faces intense competition from established players. To design and launch a credit card product that meets market demands and minimizes the risk of failure, the bank must carefully assess multiple factors influencing customer preferences and credit usage patterns.

## Key Research Question

What factors should be considered when launching a new credit card? Examples include:
- Target age groups
- Employment types and professions
- Income ranges
- Preferred payment methods across demographics
- Competitive landscape and market positioning

A thorough analysis of these variables will help identify the most promising customer segments and product features for the new credit card.

## Data Source

Anonymized transactional and behavioral data may be sourced from financial analytics providers such as Bloomberg Terminal or Second Measure to replicate realistic market conditions.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Identify the target market

- Determine whether the card should focus on specific customer groups (e.g., students, mid-career professionals, or retirees).
- Segment potential users by demographic or occupational criteria.

### Phase 2: Pilot testing and validation

- Conduct a small-scale trial run based on Phase 1 insights.
- Apply statistical techniques (e.g., hypothesis testing) to evaluate the effectiveness of initial assumptions and market segmentation choices.
