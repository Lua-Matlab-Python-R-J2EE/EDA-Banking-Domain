# Database Structure

This project uses a **MySQL** relational database designed to analyze customer transactions, campaign performance, and credit profiles.  
The schema is normalized around core entities: customers, their transactions, and related credit information, with an aggregated view for campaign performance analysis.

## Relationships

- Each **customer** (`customers.cust_id`) can have multiple **transactions** (`transactions.cust_id`).  
- Each **customer** has one corresponding **credit profile** (`credit_profiles.cust_id`).  
- The **avg_transactions_after_campaign** table is an analytical summary table and does not directly reference other tables through keys.

## Notes
- All tables were modeled in **MySQL** and imported into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) for visualization.  
- Null defaults are permitted across most columns, indicating optional fields or incomplete data sources.  
- Analytical tables like `avg_transactions_after_campaign` are typically regenerated by reporting or Extract – Transform – Load (ETL) jobs.
